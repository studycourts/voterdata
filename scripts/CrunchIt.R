# Read in the 5/24/2024 precinct-level voter registration
# data from the SOS website. The link is:
#
# https://www.washoecounty.gov/voters/2024-election/2024-election-files/precinct%20count%20detail%2005-24-2024.xls
#
# Reading it directly is giving me fits rn, so I'm
# just going to keep a copy with that filename in the
# Dropbox folder, and read that instead:

pvr <- read_excel("precinct count detail 05-24-2024.xls", n_max = 456)

# Extract only the variables needed for the registration. Note that
# only REPs can vote in REP races, and only DEMs can vote in
# DEM races, but anyone can vote in NO PARTY races.

pvr <- data.frame(
  PrecinctName = pvr$NAME, TotalReg = pvr$TOTAL,
  DemReg = pvr$DEM, RepReg = pvr$REP
)

# These give us the total number of registered voters eligible
# to vote in each precinct.
#
# In the "dfl" data frame, fix the precinct names:

dfl$PrecinctName <- substr(dfl$PrecinctPortion, 1, nchar(dfl$PrecinctPortion) - 7)

# Aggregate vote counts to the precinct /candidate level, by candidate:

p.cands <- aggregate(dfl, Vote ~ PrecinctName + Race + Party + CandName + Race.PID +
  Race.Candidate.PID, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
p.cands$CandVotes <- p.cands$Vote

# Those give us the total number of votes each candidate received in each
# precinct. To get the total number of votes cast in each race at the
# precinct level, we can aggregate *those* ("p.cants") data by race:

p.races <- aggregate(p.cands, Vote ~ PrecinctName + Race.PID, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
p.races$RaceVotes <- p.races$Vote
p.races$Vote <- NULL

# Now merge those two:

p.cands <- merge(p.cands, p.races, by = c("PrecinctName", "Race.PID"))

# And now (maybe?) merge in the precinct-level voter registration data:

p.cands <- merge(p.cands, pvr, by = c("PrecinctName"))

# Flag precincts where recorded turnout was greater than
# recorded voter registration:

p.cands$flag <- p.cands$TotalReg < p.cands$RaceVotes

# Now, looking for "fraud"...
#
# First, the Republican County Commission race in
# District Four. There were five candidates running:
# Andriola,* Lawson, Hilton-Thomas, Gomez, and Walter.
#
# Extract that race:

# The second is for school board trustee, District G
# (at-large). There were seven candidates: Rosenstein,*
# Nicolet, Woo, White, Lehman, Di Carlo, and
# Phillipps.
#
# Extract those data:

# There are two precincts in this race (RENO-VERDI 5020
# and RENO-VERDI 9103) that show zero registered voters in
# the SOS voter registration data, but which have votes
# in this race. This is likely because of late registrations
# between the 5/28 SOS data pull and the day of the primary
# in June. We'll drop those precincts:

SBDG <- SBDG[SBDG$flag == FALSE, ]

# Similarly, there are four precincts where the total
# number of votes in the race ("RaceVotes") was zero.
# We're dropping those precincts as well:

SBDG <- SBDG[SBDG$RaceVotes > 0, ]

# Now, create a column that is the number of registered
# Ds if the ballot is a Democratic one, the number of GOPers
# if it's Republican, and (Total - Dem - Rep) if it's
# neither:

# Looking for identical ballots...              ####
#
# "BallotType" identifies each unique ballot type. There
# are 164 different ballot types; each ballot type has
# a different number of possible candidates.
#
# A ballot type is defined by location and party;
# the ballot type in turn tells us which candidates
# are available to vote for.
#
# Within each ballot type, we can calculate the possible
# number of unique voting patterns; because each candidate
# can have a vote for (=1) or against (=0); note that some
# races include a "None of these candidates" option, which
# is included here. In a race with N candidates, in which
# the voter chooses one, the number of possible patterns
# in that race is just N (formally, (N! / (1! * (N-1)!))).
#
# If a ballot has K races on it, and each race has N_k
# candidates (k=1...K), then the total possible
# number of vote patterns is:
#
# \prod_{k=1}^{K} N_{k}
#
# So a ballot with four races, each of which has 5, 4, 2, and
# 8 candidates running, respectively, has a possible
# 5*4*2*8 = 320 patterns of votes.
#
